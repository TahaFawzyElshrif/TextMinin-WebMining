Humans started to master that process in  during the  and the use of iron  and  began to displace —in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the  to the . In the , iron alloys, such as , ,  and , are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The  is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and  to produce brown-to-black  , commonly known as . Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form  layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. High-purity irons (e.g. ) are more resistant to corrosion.The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in  and . These two  play essential roles in  , respectively  by  and oxygen storage in . To maintain the necessary levels,  requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important   dealing with  and  in plants and animals.Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are  and . Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other ,  and . Iron forms compounds in a wide range of , −4 to +7. Iron also forms many ; some of them, such as , , and  have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.Main article:  Molar volume vs. pressure for α iron at room temperatureAt least four allotropes of iron (differing atom arrangements in the solid) are known, conventionally denoted , , , and .The first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538 °C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, which has a  (bcc) . As it cools further to 1394 °C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a  (fcc) crystal structure, or . At 912 °C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope.The physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into another  (hcp) structure, which is also known as . The higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher pressure.Some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable  phase at pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K. It is supposed to have an  or a double hcp structure. (Confusingly, the term \"β-iron\" is sometimes also used to refer to α-iron above its Curie point, when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, even though its crystal structure has not changed.)The  of the  is generally presumed to consist of an iron-  with ε (or β) structure. Low-pressure  of pure ironThe melting and boiling points of iron, along with its , are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from  to , showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element  because that element has a half-filled 3d sub-shell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than 50 GPa. For greater pressures, published data (as of 2007) still varies by tens of gigapascals and over a thousand kelvin.

This happens because the orbitals of those two electrons (dz2 and dx2 −. y2) do not point toward neighboring atoms in the lattice, and therefore are not involved in metallic bonding.In the absence of an external source of magnetic field, the atoms get spontaneously partitioned into , about 10 micrometers across, such that the atoms in each domain have parallel spins, but some domains have other orientations. Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field.Application of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field. This effect is exploited in devices that need to channel magnetic fields to fulfill design function, such as ,  heads, and . Impurities, , or grain and particle boundaries can \"pin\" the domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed – thus turning the iron object into a (permanent) .Similar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the  including the mineral , a crystalline form of the mixed iron(II,III) oxide Fe3O4 (although the atomic-scale mechanism, , is somewhat different). Pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization () provided the earliest  for navigation. Particles of magnetite were extensively used in magnetic recording media such as , , , and , until they were replaced by -based materials.Main article: Iron has four stable : 54Fe (5.845% of natural iron),  (91.754%), 57Fe (2.119%) and 58Fe (0.282%). 24 artificial isotopes have also been created. Of these stable isotopes, only 57Fe has a  (−1⁄2). The  54Fe theoretically can undergo  to 54Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×1022 years has been established.60Fe is an  of long  (2.6 million years). It is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter, the stable nuclide . Much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the  of 60Fe through studies of  and ore formation. In the last decade, advances in  have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  of iron. Much of this work is driven by the  and  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging.In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut, a correlation between the concentration of 60Ni, the  of 60Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of 60Fe at the time of . Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60Fe, along with that released by , contributed to the remelting and  of  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of 60Ni present in  material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the .The most abundant iron isotope 56Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of . Since 56Ni (14 ) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  in  in supernovae (see ), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside , since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the most abundant element in the core of , and is the most abundant metal in  and in the dense metal  such as . It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable  of approximately the same . Iron is the sixth most  in the , and the most common  element.   for iron.Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing , which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a  for their formation, involving  by starting 56Fe nuclei.In the  of the universe, assuming that  does not occur, cold  occurring via  would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei. Fission and  would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.Iron's abundance in  like Earth is due to its abundant production during the runaway fusion and explosion of type , which scatters the iron into space. A polished and chemically etched piece of an iron meteorite, believed to be similar in composition to the Earth's metallic core, showing individual crystals of the iron-nickel alloy ()Metallic or  is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize. However, both the Earth's  and , which together account for 35% of the mass of the whole Earth, are believed to consist largely of an iron alloy, possibly with . Electric currents in the liquid outer core are believed to be the origin of the . The other  (, , and ) as well as the  are believed to have a metallic core consisting mostly of iron. The  are also believed to be partly or mostly made of metallic iron alloy.The rare  are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface. Items made of  meteoritic iron have been found in various archaeological sites dating from a time when iron smelting had not yet been developed; and the  in  have been reported to use iron from the  for tools and hunting weapons. About 1 in 20  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  (35–80% iron) and  (90–95% iron). Native iron is also rarely found in basalts that have formed from magmas that have come into contact with carbon-rich sedimentary rocks, which have reduced the oxygen  sufficiently for iron to crystallize. This is known as  and is described from a few localities, such as  in West Greenland,  in Russia and Bühl in Germany. (Mg,Fe)O, a solid solution of  (MgO) and  (FeO), makes up about 20% of the volume of the  of the Earth, which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after  (Mg,Fe)SiO3; it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle. At the bottom of the  of the mantle, the reaction γ-(Mg,Fe)2[SiO4] ↔ (Mg,Fe)[SiO3] + (Mg,Fe)O transforms  into a mixture of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase and vice versa. In the literature, this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesiowüstite.  may form up to 93% of the lower mantle, and the magnesium iron form, (Mg,Fe)SiO3, is considered to be the most abundant  in the Earth, making up 38% of its volume. Ochre path in .While iron is the most abundant element on Earth, most of this iron is concentrated in the  and  cores. The fraction of iron that is in  only amounts to about 5% of the overall mass of the crust and is thus only the fourth most abundant element in that layer (after , , and ).Most of the iron in the crust is combined with various other elements to form many . An important class is the  minerals such as  (Fe2O3),  (Fe3O4), and  (FeCO3), which are the major . Many  also contain the sulfide minerals  and . During , iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as . Banded iron formation in McKinley Park, Minnesota.Large deposits of iron are , a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron-poor  and . The banded iron formations were laid down in the time between  million years ago and  million years ago.Materials containing finely ground iron(III) oxides or oxide-hydroxides, such as , have been used as yellow, red, and brown  since pre-historical times. They contribute as well to the color of various rocks and , including entire geological formations like the  in  and the  (\"colored sandstone\", British ). Through Eisensandstein (a  'iron sandstone', e.g. from  in Germany) and  in the UK, iron compounds are responsible for the yellowish color of many historical buildings and sculptures. The proverbial  is derived from an iron oxide-rich .Significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral  (FeS2), but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not exploited. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it.According to the 's , the global stock of iron in use in society is 2,200 kg per capita. More-developed countries differ in this respect from less-developed countries (7,000–14,000 vs 2,000 kg per capita).Ocean science demonstrated the role of the iron in the ancient seas in both marine biota and climate.See also: Oxidation stateRepresentative compound−4 (d12)[FeIn6−xSnx]−2 (d10) (Collman's reagent)−1 (d9)Fe2(CO)2−80 (d8)1 (d7) (\"Fp2\")2 (d6), 3 (d5), 4 (d4)Fe(diars)2Cl2+2, FeO(BF4)25 (d3)FeO3−46 (d2)7 (d1)[FeO4]– (matrix isolation, 4K)Iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the , namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, , that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the  [Ar]3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus a number of electrons can be ionized.Iron forms compounds mainly in the  +2 (, \"ferrous\") and +3 (, \"ferric\"). Iron also occurs in , e.g., the purple  (K2FeO4), which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state. The anion [FeO4]– with iron in its +7 oxidation state, along with an iron(V)-peroxo isomer, has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4 K after cocondensation of laser-ablated Fe atoms with a mixture of O2/Ar. Iron(IV) is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions. Numerous  compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2. The oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of . Many  contain both iron(II) and iron(III) centers, such as  and  (Fe4(Fe[CN]6)3). The latter is used as the traditional \"blue\" in .Iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium. Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In the second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors  and  in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at  and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the .Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with . As a result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34 kg) made of iron.Iron is by far the most reactive element in its group; it is  when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not react with concentrated  and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with . High-purity iron, called , is considered to be resistant to rust, due to its oxide layer.Oxides and sulfidesFerrous or iron(II) oxide, FeOFerric or iron(III) oxide Fe2O3Ferrosoferric or iron(II,III) oxide Fe3O4Iron forms various ; the most common are  (Fe3O4), and  (Fe2O3).  also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all  whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see  and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of , useful  media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is  (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster. It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II)  containing Fe2+ and S2−2 ions in a distorted  structure.  of ironHalides Hydrated iron(III) chloride (ferric chloride)The binary ferrous and ferric  are well-known. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding  to give the corresponding hydrated salts.Fe + 2 HX → FeX2 + H2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I)Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides,  being the most common.2 Fe + 3 X2 → 2 FeX3 (X = F, Cl, Br)Ferric iodide is an exception, being thermodynamically unstable due to the oxidizing power of Fe3+ and the high reducing power of I−:2 I− + 2 Fe3+ → I2 + 2 Fe2+ (E0 = +0.23 V)Ferric iodide, a black solid, is not stable in ordinary conditions, but can be prepared through the reaction of  with  and  in the presence of  and light at the temperature of −20 °C, with oxygen and water excluded.Complexes of ferric iodide with some soft bases are known to be stable compounds. Comparison of colors of solutions of ferrate (left) and  (right)The  in acidic aqueous solution for some common iron ions are given below:[Fe(H2O)6]2+ + 2 e−⇌ FeE0 = −0.447 V[Fe(H2O)6]3+ + e−⇌ [Fe(H2O)6]2+E0 = +0.77 VFeO2−4 + 8 H3O+ + 3 e−⇌ [Fe(H2O)6]3+ + 6 H2OE0 = +2.20 VThe red-purple tetrahedral (VI) anion is such a strong oxidizing agent that it oxidizes ammonia to nitrogen (N2) and water to oxygen4 FeO2−4 + 34 H2O → 4 [Fe(H2O)6]3+ + 20 OH− + 3 O2The pale-violet hex [Fe(H2O)6]3+ is an acid such that above pH 0 it is fully hydrolyzed:[Fe(H2O)6]3+⇌ [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+ + H+ = 10−3.05 mol dm−3[Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+⇌ [Fe(H2O)4(OH)2]+ + H+K = 10−3.26 mol dm−32[Fe(H2O)6]3+⇌ [Fe(H2O)4(OH)]4+2 + 2H+ + 2H2OK = 10−2.91 mol dm−3 Blue-green  heptahydrateAs pH rises above 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous  precipitates out of solution. Although Fe3+ has a d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal  absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion [Fe(H2O)6]2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when  anions are added, which instead results in white  being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form  that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.Due to its electronic structure, iron has a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry. The two  of the ferrioxalate ionMany coordination compounds of iron are known. A typical six-coordinate anion is hexachloroferrate(III), [FeCl6]3−, found in the mixed  . Complexes with multiple bidentate ligands have . For example, the trans- complex is used as a starting material for compounds with the Fe()2 . The ferrioxalate ion with three  ligands (shown at right) displays  with its two non-superposable geometries labelled Λ (lambda) for the left-handed screw axis and Δ (delta) for the right-handed screw axis, in line with IUPAC conventions.  is used in chemical  and along with its  undergoes  applied in old-style photographic processes. The  of  has a  structure with co-planar oxalate ions bridging between iron centres with the water of crystallisation located forming the caps of each octahedron, as illustrated below. Crystal structure of iron(II) oxalate dihydrate, showing iron (gray), oxygen (red), carbon (black), and hydrogen (white) atoms. Blood-red positive thiocyanate test for iron(III)Iron(III) complexes are quite similar to those of (III) with the exception of iron(III)'s preference for O-donor instead of N-donor ligands. The latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron(II) complexes and often dissociate in water. Many Fe–O complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for  or . For example, in the , used to determine the presence of phenols,  reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex:3 ArOH + FeCl3 → Fe(OAr)3 + 3 HCl (Ar = )Among the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron(III) are the most stable, with the colorless [FeF5(H2O)]2− being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in [FeCl4]−; [FeBr4]− and [FeI4]− are reduced easily to iron(II).  is a common test for the presence of iron(III) as it forms the blood-red [Fe(SCN)(H2O)5]2+. Like manganese(II), most iron(III) complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the  such as . An example of a low-spin iron(III) complex is [Fe(CN)6]3−. Iron shows a great variety of electronic , including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to 5⁄2 (5 unpaired electrons). This value is always half the number of unpaired electrons. Complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five are considered high-spin.Iron(II) complexes are less stable than iron(III) complexes but the preference for O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example [Fe(NH3)6]2+ is known while [Fe(NH3)6]3+ is not. They have a tendency to be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used. Iron penta-carbonyl is the study of  of iron, where carbon atoms are covalently bound to the metal atom. They are many and varied, including , ,  and . Prussian blue or \"ferric ferrocyanide\", Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, is an old and well-known iron-cyanide complex, extensively used as pigment and in several other applications. Its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as they react (respectively) with  and  to form Prussian blue.Another old example of an organoiron compound is , Fe(CO)5, in which a neutral iron atom is bound to the carbon atoms of five  molecules. The compound can be used to make  powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron.  of iron pentacarbonyl gives , Fe3(CO)12, a complex with a cluster of three iron atoms at its core. Collman's reagent, , is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state.  contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.Structural formula of ferrocene and a powdered sampleA landmark in this field was the discovery in 1951 of the remarkably stable   Fe(C5H5)2, by Pauson and Kealy and independently by Miller and colleagues, whose surprising molecular structure was determined only a year later by  and  and .Ferrocene is still one of the most important tools and models in this class.Iron-centered organometallic species are used as . The , for example, is a  catalyst for .The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are  (FeSO4·7) and  (FeCl3). The former is one of the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than  ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.Main article: Iron is one of the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world. It has been worked, or , for millennia. However, iron artefacts of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease with which iron corrodes. The technology developed slowly, and even after the discovery of smelting it took many centuries for iron to replace bronze as the metal of choice for tools and weapons.Meteoritic iron Iron harpoon head from . The iron edge covers a  tusk harpoon using meteorite iron from the , one of the largest iron meteorites known.Beads made from  in 3500 BC or earlier were found in , Egypt by G.A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities.Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a  made of meteoric iron was found in the tomb of , containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500 BC.Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily  but may get brittle when heated because of the  content.Wrought ironMain article: Further information:  The symbol for  has been used since antiquity to represent iron.  The  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of early India.The first iron production started in the , but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of  iron from , Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700 BC. The  established an empire in north-central  around 1600 BC. They appear to be the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The  began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200 BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180 BC. The subsequent period is called the .Artifacts of smelted iron are found in  dating from 1800 to 1200 BC, and in the  from about 1500 BC (suggesting smelting in  or the ). Alleged references (compare ) to iron in the Indian  have been used for claims of a very early usage of iron in India respectively to date the texts as such. The  term ayas (metal) refers to copper, while iron which is called as śyāma ayas, literally \"black copper\", first is mentioned in the post-rigvedic .Some archaeological evidence suggests iron was smelted in  and southeast Africa as early as the eighth century BC. Iron working was introduced to  in the late 11th century BC, from which it spread quickly throughout Europe. Iron sickle from Ancient Greece.The spread of ironworking in Central and Western Europe is associated with  expansion. According to , iron use was common in the  era. In the lands of what is now considered China, iron appears approximately 700–500 BC. Iron smelting may have been introduced into China through Central Asia. The earliest evidence of the use of a  in China dates to the 1st century AD, and cupola furnaces were used as early as the  (403–221 BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the  and  dynasties.During the Industrial Revolution in Britain,  began refining iron from  to  (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the  for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including .Cast ironMain article:  was first produced in  during 5th century BC, but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period. The earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern ,  in China. Cast iron was used in  for warfare, agriculture, and architecture. During the  period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as ) using . For all these processes,  was required as fuel. , 1801. Blast furnaces light the iron making town of .Medieval  were about 10 feet (3.0 m) tall and made of fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows. Modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger, with hearths fourteen meters in diameter that allow them to produce thousands of tons of iron each day, but essentially operate in much the same way as they did during medieval times.In 1709,  established a -fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the . Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative  in 1778. This bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in . Railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress and various languages refer to railways as iron road (e.g. French chemin de fer, German Eisenbahn, Turkish demiryolu, Russian железная дорога,  鐵道, Vietnamese đường sắt).SteelMain article: See also: Steel (with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity by using a . Blacksmiths in  in western Persia were making good steel by 1000 BC. Then improved versions,  by India and  were developed around 300 BC and AD 500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.New methods of producing it by  bars of iron in the  were devised in the 17th century. In the , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.In 1774,  used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce  in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the , which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one. \"Ich gab Gold für Eisen\" – \"I gave gold for iron\".  brooch from WWI.Iron plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage  and in . The  poet 's  (lines 109–201) lists different  named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity. The Iron Age was closely related with Rome, and in Ovid's MetamorphosesThe Virtues, in despair, quit the earth; and the depravity of man becomes universal and complete. Hard steel succeeded then.— Ovid, , Book I, Iron age, line 160 ffAn example of the importance of iron's symbolic role may be found in the .  commissioned then the first  as military decoration.  reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian  urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription Ich gab Gold für Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts. For a few limited purposes when it is needed, pure iron is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250 °C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.See also: Iron production 2009 (million )[  – ]Country 1,114.9549.4573.6 393.94.45.2 305.025.10.01126.5 66.987.5 257.438.223.463.5 92.143.94.760.0 65.825.729.9 0.127.348.6 0.420.10.3832.7World1,594.9914.064.51,232.4Nowadays, the industrial production of iron or steel consists of two main stages. In the first stage, iron ore is  with  in a , and the molten metal is separated from gross impurities such as . This stage yields an alloy——that contains relatively large amounts of carbon. In the second stage, the amount of carbon in the pig iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron, steel, or cast iron. Other metals can be added at this stage to form .Blast furnace processingMain article: The blast furnace is loaded with iron ores, usually  Fe2O3 or  Fe3O4, along with coke ( that has been separately baked to remove volatile components) and  ( or ). \"Blasts\" of air pre-heated to 900 °C (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown through the mixture, in sufficient amount to turn the carbon into :2C+O2⟶2CO{\\displaystyle {\\ce {2 C + O2 -> 2 CO}}}This reaction raises the temperature to about 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore to metallic ironFe2O3+3CO⟶2Fe+3CO2{\\displaystyle {\\ce {Fe2O3 + 3 CO -> 2 Fe + 3 CO2}}}Some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke:2Fe2O3+3C⟶4Fe+3CO2{\\displaystyle {\\ce {2Fe2O3 + 3C -> 4Fe + 3CO2}}}The flux removes silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace: The heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to , which reacts with any excess  to form a  composed of  CaSiO3 or other products. At the furnace's temperature, the metal and the slag are both molten. They collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers (with the slag on top), that are then easily separated. The slag can be used as a material in  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for .Steelmaking thus remains one of the largest industrial contributors of CO2 emissions in the world.SteelmakingMain articles:  and The pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to 4–5% carbon (by mass), with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese. This high level of carbon makes it relatively weak and brittle. Reducing the amount of carbon to 0.002–2.1% produces , which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. A great variety of steel articles can then be made by , , , , etc. Removing the impurities from pig iron, but leaving 2–4% carbon, results in , which is cast by  into articles such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts, and rails.Steel products often undergo various  after they are forged to shape.  consists of heating them to 700–800 °C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.Owing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. \"\"  to a ferrous lump called  or \"direct\" iron that is suitable for steelmaking. Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:Natural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):2CH4+O2⟶2CO+4H2{\\displaystyle {\\ce {2 CH4 + O2 -> 2 CO + 4 H2}}}Iron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:Fe2O3+CO+2H2⟶2Fe+CO2+2H2O{\\displaystyle {\\ce {Fe2O3 + CO + 2 H2 -> 2 Fe + CO2 + 2 H2O}}} is removed by adding a  flux as described above.Main article: Ignition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron via the :Fe2O3+2Al⟶2Fe+Al2O3{\\displaystyle {\\ce {Fe2O3 + 2 Al -> 2 Fe + Al2O3}}}Alternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including ,  furnaces, , , , and . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels. uses an alloy of chromium, iron and other metals that does not react with oxygen and a liquid iron cathode while the electrolyte is a mixture of molten metal oxides into which iron ore is dissolved. The current keeps the electrolyte molten, and reduces the iron oxide. In addition to pure liquid iron, put oxygen is also produced, which can be sold to offset part of the cost. Production cell size is variable and can be much smaller than conventional furnaces. The only cardon dioxide emissions come from the electricity used to heat and reduce the metal.Characteristic values of  (TS) and  (BH) of various forms of iron.MaterialTS (MPa)BH ()11000Ausformed (hardened) steel2930850–1200207060013804001200350 iron690200Small-grain iron340100Carbon-containing iron14040Pure, single-crystal iron103Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength often make it the material of choice to withstand stress or transmit forces, such as the construction of machinery and , , , , , and the load-carrying framework of buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.Mechanical propertiesThe mechanical properties of iron and its alloys are extremely relevant to their structural applications. Those properties can be evaluated in various ways, including the , the  and the .The properties of pure iron are often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30 Brinell. The pure iron (99.9%～99.999%), especially called , is industrially produced by .An increase in the carbon content will cause a significant increase in the hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of  is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier   and .Types of steels and alloysSee also:  Iron-carbon phase diagramα-Iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 °C).  (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 °C). This form of iron is used in the type of  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives.  has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as , silicon and . Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of . Pig iron has a  in the range of 1420–1470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.\"White\" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of , or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723 °C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and α-iron, which is soft and malleable and is called  for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle . The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-αFe mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.In  the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of , and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce  sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as , is specially treated with trace amounts of  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material. contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic. It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  entrapped within the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  for traditional \"wrought iron\" products and .Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available.  contains 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of , , , and silicon.  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as , , , nickel, , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is . Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed '' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.Alloys with high purity elemental makeups (such as alloys of ) have specifically enhanced properties such as , , , , heat resistance, and corrosion resistance.Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, , it is much stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph.The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  if not protected in some way, a cost amounting to over 1% of the world's economy. , , , plastic coating and  are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding  and oxygen or by . The mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows:Cathode: 3 O2 + 6 H2O + 12 e− → 12 OH−Anode: 4 Fe → 4 Fe2+ + 8 e−; 4 Fe2+ → 4 Fe3+ + 4 e−Overall: 4 Fe + 3 O2 + 6 H2O → 4 Fe3+ + 12 OH− → 4 Fe(OH)3 or 4 FeO(OH) + 4 H2OThe electrolyte is usually  in urban areas (formed when atmospheric  attacks iron), and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas.Because Fe is inexpensive and nontoxic, much effort has been devoted to the development of Fe-based catalysts and .  Iron is however less common as a catalyst in commercial processes than more expensive metals.  In biology, Fe-containing enzymes are pervasive.Iron catalysts are traditionally used in the  for the production of ammonia and the  for conversion of carbon monoxide to  for fuels and lubricants. Powdered iron in an acidic medium is used in the , the conversion of  to . mixed with  powder can be ignited to create a , used in welding large iron parts (like ) and purifying ores. Iron(III) oxide and  are used as reddish and ocher . finds use in water purification and , in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an  for  in the manufacture of . It can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron, which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in . is used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is also used to  chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat .  is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water.  is used as a reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis. is a drug used as a . It is on the .Main article: Iron is required for life. The  are pervasive and include , the enzymes responsible for biological . Iron-containing proteins participate in transport, storage and use of oxygen. Iron proteins are involved in . Simplified structure of ; in the protein additional (s) are attached to Fe.Examples of iron-containing proteins in higher organisms include hemoglobin,  (see ), and . The average adult human contains about 0.005% body weight of iron, or about four grams, of which three quarters is in hemoglobin – a level that remains constant despite only about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day, because the human body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content.Microbial growth may be assisted by oxidation of iron(II) or by reduction of iron (III).Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes, sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it back to ferric iron. In particular, bacteria have evolved very high-affinity  agents called .After uptake in human , iron storage is precisely regulated. A major component of this regulation is the protein , which binds iron ions absorbed from the  and carries it in the  to cells. Transferrin contains Fe3+ in the middle of a distorted octahedron, bonded to one nitrogen, three oxygens and a chelating  anion that traps the Fe3+ ion: it has such a high  that it is very effective at taking up Fe3+ ions even from the most stable complexes. At the bone marrow, transferrin is reduced from Fe3+ and Fe2+ and stored as  to be incorporated into hemoglobin.The most commonly known and studied  iron compounds (biological iron molecules) are the : examples are , , and . These compounds participate in transporting gases, building , and transferring .  are a group of proteins with metal ion . Some examples of iron metalloproteins are  and . Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as , , and .Hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in  and contributes their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to , which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of , generating energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to , produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as  anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four  groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a  ring, the fifth by an  nitrogen in a  residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion at the center of the  group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a . It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55 picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.When deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a  with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue. As described by the  (named after , the father of ), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide. A heme unit of human , showing the  at the apical position, trans to the histidine residue and  are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but with much more strength, so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body. Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as . This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of , but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein . The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a  sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen – with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide. Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in . Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:4 Cytc2+ + O2 + 8H+inside → 4 Cytc3+ + 2 H2O + 4H+outsideAlthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the  are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is , which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from  residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron–sulfur proteins is the , which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.The ability of sea  to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of  iron-based bonds in their protein-rich . Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased  770 times,  58 times, and  92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.DietIron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include , , , , , , , , and .  and  are sometimes specifically fortified with iron.Iron provided by  is often found as , although  is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when  to amino acids and is also available for use as a common . , the least expensive amino acid, is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.Dietary recommendationsThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iron in 2001. The current EAR for iron for women ages 14–18 is 7.9 mg/day, 8.1 for ages 19–50 and 5.0 thereafter (post menopause). For men the EAR is 6.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. The RDA is 15.0 mg/day for women ages 15–18, 18.0 for 19–50 and 8.0 thereafter. For men, 8.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 27 mg/day and, for lactation, 9 mg/day. For children ages 1–3 years 7 mg/day, 10 for ages 4–8 and 8 for ages 9–13. As for safety, the IOM also sets  (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of iron the UL is set at 45 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as .The  (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women the PRI is 13 mg/day ages 15–17 years, 16 mg/day for women ages 18 and up who are premenopausal and 11 mg/day postmenopausal. For pregnancy and lactation, 16 mg/day. For men the PRI is 11 mg/day ages 15 and older. For children ages 1 to 14 the PRI increases from 7 to 11 mg/day. The PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs, with the exception of pregnancy. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question did not establish a UL.Infants may require iron supplements if they are bottle-fed cow's milk. Frequent  are at risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake.For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For iron labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 18 mg, and as of May 27, 2016 remained unchanged at 18 mg. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at .Main article: Iron deficiency is the most common  in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of  occurs, which over time leads to  if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children,  women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.The brain is resistant to acute iron deficiency due to the slow transport of iron through the blood brain barrier. Acute fluctuations in iron status (marked by serum ferritin levels) do not reflect brain iron status, but prolonged nutritional iron deficiency is suspected to reduce brain iron concentrations over time. In the brain, iron plays a role in oxygen transport, myelin synthesis, mitochondrial respiration, and as a cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. Animal models of nutritional iron deficiency report biomolecular changes resembling those seen in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. However, age-related accumulation of iron in the brain has also been linked to the development of Parkinson's.Main article:  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a  that maps to the HLA-H gene region on  and leads to abnormally low levels of , a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in , known medically as . Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.Overdoses of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with  to produce highly reactive  that can damage , , , and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of  to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the  can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the ,  and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include , , , , , long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20 milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60 milligrams per kilogram is considered a . Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The  (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45 mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.The medical management of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include use of a specific  agent called  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.Some research has suggested that low  iron levels may play a role in the pathophysiology of . Some researchers have found that iron supplementation can be effective especially in the  of the disorder. One study also showed that iron may be able to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events during treatment with ADHD drugs.Some researchers in the 2000s suggested a link between low levels of iron in the blood and ADHD. A 2012 study found no such correlation.The role of iron in cancer defense can be described as a \"double-edged sword\" because of its pervasive presence in non-pathological processes. People having  may develop iron deficiency and , for which  is used to restore iron levels. Iron overload, which may occur from high consumption of red meat, may initiate  growth and increase susceptibility to cancer onset, particularly for .Iron plays an essential role in marine systems and can act as a limiting nutrient for planktonic activity. Because of this, too much of a decrease in iron may lead to a decrease in growth rates in phytoplanktonic organisms such as diatoms. Iron can also be oxidized by marine microbes under conditions that are high in iron and low in oxygen.Iron can enter marine systems through adjoining rivers and directly from the atmosphere. Once iron enters the ocean, it can be distributed throughout the water column through ocean mixing and through recycling on the cellular level. In the arctic, sea ice plays a major role in the store and distribution of iron in the ocean, depleting oceanic iron as it freezes in the winter and releasing it back into the water when thawing occurs in the summer. The iron cycle can fluctuate the forms of iron from aqueous to particle forms altering the availability of iron to primary producers. Increased light and warmth increases the amount of iron that is in forms that are usable by primary producers. . . 1993. Ram, R. S.; Bernath, P. F.

Nitrogen is a  and the lightest member of  of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the , estimated at  in the  and the . At , two atoms of the element  to form N2, a colorless and odorless  . N2 forms about 78% of , making it the most abundant uncombined element in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.It was discovered and isolated by Scottish physician  in 1772, (first publication).  and  independently did so at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist  in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in  and .  suggested instead the name azote, from the : ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an ; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as ,  and .Elemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by  technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as  in  applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as , nitric acid, organic nitrates ( and ), and , contain nitrogen. The extremely strong  in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any  after  (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful , but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial , and fertiliser nitrates are key  in the  of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as  used in high-strength fabric and  used in . Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in  (and thus ), in the  ( and ) and in the energy transfer molecule . The  about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The  describes the movement of the element from the air, into the  and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including . Many drugs are mimics or  of natural nitrogen-containing : for example, the organic nitrates  and  control  by metabolizing into . Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural  and  or the synthetic , act on receptors of animal . , discoverer of nitrogenNitrogen compounds have a very long history,  having been known to . They were well-known by the Middle Ages.  knew nitric acid as  (strong water), as well as other nitrogen compounds such as  salts and  salts. The mixture of nitric and  was known as  (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve , the king of metals.The discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician  in 1772, who called it noxious air. Though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance, he clearly distinguished it from Joseph Black's , or carbon dioxide. The fact that there was a component of air that does not support  was clear to Rutherford, although he was not aware that it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by , , and , who referred to it as burnt air or . French chemist  referred to nitrogen gas as \"\" or azote, from the  word άζωτικός (azotikos), \"no life\", due to it being . In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, animals died and flames were extinguished. Though Lavoisier's name was not accepted in English since it was pointed out that all gases but oxygen are either asphyxiant or outright toxic, it is used in many languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Turkish, etc.; the German Stickstoff similarly refers to the same characteristic, viz. ersticken \"to choke or suffocate\") and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as  and compounds of the  ion. Finally, it led to the name \"\" for the group headed by nitrogen, from the Greek πνίγειν \"to choke\".The English word nitrogen (1794) entered the language from the French nitrogène, coined in 1790 by French chemist  (1756–1832), from the French nitre (, also called ) and the French suffix -gène, \"producing\", from the  -γενής (-genes, \"begotten\"). Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of , which in turn was produced from . In earlier times, niter had been confused with Egyptian \"natron\" () – called νίτρον (nitron) in Greek – which, despite the name, contained no nitrate.The earliest military, industrial, and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter ( or potassium nitrate), most notably in , and later as . In 1910,  discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced \"active nitrogen\", a   of nitrogen. The \"whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light\" produced by his apparatus reacted with  to produce explosive .For a long time, sources of nitrogen compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions.  by industrial processes like the  (1895–1899) and  (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, to the extent that half of global  (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the  (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as  in the manufacture of  in the  of the 20th century. The shapes of the five orbitals occupied in nitrogen. The two colours show the phase or sign of the wave function in each region. From left to right: 1s, 2s (cutaway to show internal structure), 2px, 2py, 2pz.A nitrogen atom has seven electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration 1s22s22p1x2p1y2p1z. It, therefore, has five  in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It has one of the highest  among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by  (3.16),  (3.44), and  (3.98). (The light , , , and , would presumably also be more electronegative, and in fact are on the Allen scale.) Following periodic trends, its single-bond  of 71 pm is smaller than those of  (84 pm) and  (76 pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66 pm) and fluorine (57 pm). The  anion, N3−, is much larger at 146 pm, similar to that of the  (O2−: 140 pm) and  (F−: 133 pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577 MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920 MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.The lack of radial nodes in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the , especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating . It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities.  is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich  since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners , , , and .Nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours' carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Although each period 2 element from lithium to oxygen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group (from magnesium to chlorine; these are known as ), their degree drops off abruptly past the boron–silicon pair. The similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present.Nitrogen does not share the proclivity of carbon for . Like carbon, nitrogen tends to form ionic or metallic compounds with metals. Nitrogen forms an extensive series of nitrides with carbon, including those with chain-, , and -like structures.It resembles oxygen with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for  and the ability to form  by donating its  of electrons. There are some parallels between the chemistry of ammonia NH3 and water H2O. For example, the capacity of both compounds to be protonated to give NH4+ and H3O+ or deprotonated to give NH2− and OH−, with all of these able to be isolated in solid compounds.Nitrogen shares with both its horizontal neighbours a preference for forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, oxygen, or other nitrogen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions. Thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and therefore has very much lower  (−210 °C) and  (−196 °C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak  and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the , , , , -, -, and -compounds, , , , and -derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen. Setting aside their differences, nitrogen and phosphorus form an extensive series of compounds with one another; these have chain, ring, and cage structures.Table of thermal and physical properties of nitrogen (N2) at atmospheric pressure:Temperature (K)Density (kg m−3)Specific heat (kJ kg−1 °C−1)Dynamic viscosity (kg m−1 s−1)Kinematic viscosity (m2 s−1)Thermal conductivity (W m−1 °C−1)Thermal diffusivity (m2 s−1)1003.43881.07  6.88×10−62.00×10−60.009582.60×10−60.7681502.25941.05  1.01×10−54.45×10−60.0139 5.86×10−60.7592001.71081.04291.29×10−57.57×10−60.018241.02×10−50.7473001.14211.04081.78×10−51.56×10−50.0262 2.20×10−50.7134000.85381.04592.20×10−52.57×10−50.033353.73×10−50.6915000.68241.05552.57×10−53.77×10−50.039845.53×10−50.6846000.56871.07562.91×10−55.12×10−50.0458 7.49×10−50.6867000.49341.09693.21×10−56.67×10−50.051239.47×10−50.6918000.42771.12253.48×10−58.15×10−50.056091.17×10−40.7  9000.37961.14643.75×10−59.11×10−50.0607 1.39×10−40.71110000.34121.16774.00×10−51.19×10−40.064751.63×10−40.72411000.31081.18574.23×10−51.36×10−40.0685 1.86×10−40.73612000.28511.20374.45×10−51.56×10−40.071842.09×10−40.74813000.25911.219 4.66×10−51.80×10−40.081  2.56×10−40.701Main article:  Table of nuclides (Segrè chart) from carbon to fluorine (including nitrogen). Orange indicates  (nuclides outside the proton drip line); pink for  (inverse beta decay); black for  nuclides; blue for  (beta decay); and violet for  (nuclides outside the neutron drip line). Proton number increases going up the vertical axis and neutron number going to the right on the horizontal axis.Nitrogen has two stable : 14N and 15N. The first is much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is slightly heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007 u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the  in , but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N is one of the five stable  (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are , 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.The relative abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological  reactions and the evaporation of natural  or . Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., , , and ) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the  and depletion of the .The heavy isotope 15N was first discovered by S. M. Naudé in 1929, and soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements  and  were discovered. It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in  (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional  of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a  that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more common 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low , (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled , carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of , ,  and , where it is called .Of the ten other isotopes produced synthetically, ranging from 12N to 23N,  has a  of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives on the order of seconds (16N and 17N) or milliseconds. No other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the , leaking out a proton or neutron. Given the half-life difference, 13N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in  (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a  via proton bombardment of 16O producing 13N and an .The  16N is the dominant  in the coolant of  or  during normal operation. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an , in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy  (5 to 7 MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during  power operation. It is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle and is the primary means of detection for such leaks.See also:   of dinitrogen molecule, N2. There are five bonding orbitals and two antibonding orbitals (marked with an asterisk; orbitals involving the inner 1s electrons not shown), giving a total bond order of three.Atomic nitrogen, also known as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a  with three unpaired electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as  and  to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2 mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.Given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless  gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210 °C and boils at −196 °C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, but it will nevertheless react with  metal and some  complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N . Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76 pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41 kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's low level of chemical reactivity.Other nitrogen  and polymers may be possible. If they could be synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives.  Under extremely high pressures (1.1 million ) and high temperatures (2000 K), as produced in a , nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded  crystal structure. This structure is similar to that of , and both have extremely strong , resulting in its nickname \"nitrogen diamond\".  on the plains of  (on the bottom-right side of the image) on   next to water ice mountains (on the up-left side of the image)At , molecular nitrogen  () at 77  (−195.79 °) and  at 63 K (−210.01 °C) into the beta  crystal  form.

It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as .

These , in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in  and the  for the : these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.Dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (1) and M←N≡N→M (, bis-η1), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a  to two metal cations (μ, bis-η2) or to just one (η2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (μ3-N2). A few complexes feature multiple N2 ligands and some feature N2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N2 is isoelectronic with  (CO) and  (C2H2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in  compounds, although N2 is a weaker σ-donor and π-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that σ donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M–N bond than π back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (η1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (η2) donation.Today, dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the , accounting for several hundred compounds. They are normally prepared by three methods:Replacing labile ligands such as , , or  directly by nitrogen: these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions.Reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable co-ligand in excess under nitrogen gas. A common choice includes replacing chloride ligands with  (PMe2Ph) to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached to the original chlorine ligands.Converting a ligand with N–N bonds, such as hydrazine or azide, directly into a dinitrogen ligand.Occasionally the N≡N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex, for example by directly reacting coordinated  (NH3) with  (HNO2), but this is not generally applicable. Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown; a few exceptions are known, such as the blue [{Ti(η5-C5H5)2}2-(N2)].Nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first three , , , and , and some of the very short-lived elements after , creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications in which  has the highest nitrogen content. Many binary compounds are known: with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides, oxides, and fluorides, these are typically called . Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements (e.g. MnN, Mn6N5, Mn3N2, Mn2N, Mn4N, and MnxN for 9.2 < x < 25.3). They may be classified as \"salt-like\" (mostly ionic), covalent, \"diamond-like\", and metallic (or ), although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies. They are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia (sometimes after heating), or by  of metal amides:3 Ca + N2 → Ca3N23 Mg + 2 NH3 → Mg3N2 + 3 H2 (at 900 °C)3 Zn(NH2)2 → Zn3N2 + 4 NH3Many variants on these processes are possible. The most ionic of these nitrides are those of the  and , Li3N (Na, K, Rb, and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons) and M3N2 (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). These can formally be thought of as salts of the N3− anion, although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements. However, the alkali metal  NaN3 and KN3, featuring the linear N−3 anion, are well-known, as are Sr(N3)2 and Ba(N3)2. Azides of the B-subgroup metals (those in  through ) are much less ionic, have more complicated structures, and detonate readily when shocked. Mesomeric structures of borazine, (–BH–NH–)3Many covalent binary nitrides are known. Examples include  ((CN)2),  (P3N5),  (S2N2), and  (S4N4). The essentially covalent  (Si3N4) and  (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride, in particular, would make a promising  if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the  nitrides, most of which are promising , are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and  and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of  finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in  (\"inorganic \"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of  attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.The largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or  lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500 °C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.The nitride anion (N3−) is the strongest π donor known among ligands (the second-strongest is O2−). Nitrido complexes are generally made by the thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia, and they usually involve a terminal {≡N}3− group. The linear azide anion (N−3), being isoelectronic with , , and , forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although N4−4 (isoelectronic with  and ) is known. Standard reduction potentials for nitrogen-containing species. Top diagram shows potentials at pH 0; bottom diagram shows potentials at pH 14.Industrially,  (NH3) is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of  has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78 °C) and boiling (−33 °C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high , and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution ( 4.74); its conjugate acid is , NH+4. It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, NH−2. It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give . Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.Many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known, but the most important are  (N2H4) and  (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride,  (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similar to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0 °C, boiling point 113.5 °C, density 1.00 g/cm3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.Hydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline  in the presence of gelatin or glue:NH3 + OCl− → NH2Cl + OH−NH2Cl + NH3 → N2H+5 + Cl− (slow)N2H+5 + OH− → N2H4 + H2O (fast)(The attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed, thus passing through the intermediate NHCl− instead.) The reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as Cu2+ that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with  (NH2Cl) to produce  and nitrogen. (HN3) was first produced in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the . All four simple nitrogen trihalides are known. A few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known, but are mostly unstable; examples include NClF2, NCl2F, NBrF2, NF2H, , , and . (NF3, first prepared in 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily produced by the  of molten  dissolved in anhydrous . Like , it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with , arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give  (N2F4). The cations NF+4 and N2F+3 are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as ), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2•.  (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable.  (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN3. (NCl3) is a dense, volatile, and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of , although one difference is that NCl3 is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl4 is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by , who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour.  (NBr3), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100 °C.  (NI3) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by the touch of a feather, shifting air currents, or even . For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of \"chemical magic\".  (ClN3) and  (BrN3) are extremely sensitive and explosive.Two series of nitrogen oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first is very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide.  (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent.  (NOCl) behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent.  (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar:  (FNO2) and  (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.Main article:  Nitrogen dioxide at −196 °C, 0 °C, 23 °C, 35 °C, and 50 °C. NO2 converts to colourless dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) at low temperatures, and reverts to NO2 at higher temperatures.Nitrogen forms nine molecular oxides, some of which were the first gases to be identified: N2O (), NO (), N2O3 (), NO2 (), N2O4 (), N2O5 (), N4O (), and N(NO2)3 (). All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is  (N4O), an aromatic ring.Nitrous oxide (N2O), better known as laughing gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten  at 250 °C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for , and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot be considered to be the  of  (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or  at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600 °C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.Nitric oxide (NO) is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, it is an important cellular  involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200 °C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.Blue dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them, although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to  and  in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form . Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and  by the late 1950s. This is because it is a  in combination with a -based  and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.The thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is the anhydride of , and can be made from it by dehydration with . It is of interest for the preparation of explosives. It is a , colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light. In the solid state it is ionic with structure [NO2]+[NO3]−; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O2N–O–NO2. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with  giving  (HOONO2). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows:N2O5 ⇌ NO2 + NO3 → NO2 + O2 + NON2O5 + NO ⇌ 3 NO2Many nitrogen  are known, though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solutions or as salts.  (H2N2O2) is a weak diprotic acid with the structure HON=NOH (pKa1 6.9, pKa2 11.6). Acidic solutions are quite stable but above pH 4 base-catalysed decomposition occurs via [HONNO]− to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion.  (involving the N2O2−2 anion) are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves. They are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which occurs in the . Hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand. (HNO2) is not known as a pure compound, but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous  (NO−2, bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to  and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with pKa 3.35 at 18 °C. They may be  analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by . They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by , to hyponitrous acid with (II), and to ammonia with . Salts of  N2H+5 react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen.  is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100 mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage. It is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows:ArNH2 + HNO2 → [ArNN]Cl + 2 H2ONitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable. Fuming nitric acid contaminated with yellow nitrogen dioxide (HNO3) is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being  and ) and was first discovered by alchemists in the 13th century. It is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the , over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes  to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows:2 HNO3 ⇌ H2NO+3 + NO−3 ⇌ H2O + [NO2]+ + [NO3]−Two hydrates, HNO3·H2O and HNO3·3H2O, are known that can be crystallised. It is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents, though , , , and  are immune to attack. A 3:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, called , is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum, because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes. In concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid is protonated to form , which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration:HNO3 + 2 H2SO4 ⇌ NO+2 + H3O+ + 2 HSO−4The thermal stabilities of  (involving the trigonal planar NO−3 anion) depends on the basicity of the metal, and so do the products of decomposition (thermolysis), which can vary between the nitrite (for example, sodium), the oxide (potassium and ), or even the metal itself () depending on their relative stabilities. Nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination.Finally, although orthonitric acid (H3NO4), which would be analogous to , does not exist, the tetrahedral  anion NO3−4 is known in its sodium and potassium salts:NaNO3+Na2O→300∘C for 7daysAg crucibleNa3NO4{\\displaystyle {\\ce {NaNO3{}+Na2O->[{\\ce {Ag~crucible}}][{\\ce {300^{\\circ }C~for~7days}}]Na3NO4}}}These white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air:Na3NO4 + H2O + CO2 → NaNO3 + NaOH + NaHCO3Despite its limited chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N–O bond lengths, implying significant polar character to the bonding.Nitrogen is one of the most important elements in . Many organic  involve a , such as  (RCONR2),  (R3N),  (RC(=NR)R),  (RCO)2NR,  (RN3),  (RN2R),  and  (ROCN or RCNO),  (RONO2),  and  (RCN or RNC),  (RONO),  (RNO2),  (RNO),  (RCR=NOH), and  derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in , R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as bases at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and  is not basic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an  ring. The amount of nitrogen in a  can be determined by the . In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of ,  and thus , and the energy-carrying molecule  and is thus vital to all life on Earth. Schematic representation of the  through a land environmentSee also: Nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the volume of the  (75.5% by mass), around 3.89 million . Despite this, it is  in Earth's crust, making up somewhere around 19  of this, on par with , , and . (This represents 300,000 to a million gigatonnes of nitrogen, depending on the mass of the crust.) The only important nitrogen minerals are  (, saltpetre) and  (, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.Nitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or \"\", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by  bacteria through enzymes known as  (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, it is used to synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their proteins and excrete nitrogen-bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and , returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the  is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogen–bearing waste, when leached, leads to  of freshwater and the creation of marine , as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during denitrification, attacks the atmospheric .Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of  to protect them from the high  effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to  is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish. In animals,   (derived from an ), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.Nitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in the production of its metabolite . Animal  of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in the  of , while animal metabolism of  results in the excretion of  and . The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing , such as  and , which are breakdown products of the amino acids  and , respectively, in decaying proteins.Nitrogen gas is an  produced by the  of , or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse  or ). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk-delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of  for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20 ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2 ppm oxygen and 10 ppm  are also available.In a chemical laboratory, it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of  with .NH4Cl + NaNO2 → N2 + NaCl + 2 H2OSmall amounts of the impurities NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing . Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of  or .2 NaN3 → 2 Na + 3 N2The applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class: hence, only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here. Two-thirds (2/3) of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as gas and the remaining one-third (1/3) as a liquid.The gas is mostly used as a low reactivity safe atmosphere wherever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire, explosion, or oxidising hazard. Some examples include:Nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in . It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.Nitrogen can be used as a replacement, or in combination with,  to pressurise kegs of some , particularly  and British , due to the smaller  it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and . A pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a \"\" allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in  and . Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for . Nitrogen must be kept at a higher pressure than CO2, making N2 tanks heavier and more expensive.EquipmentSome construction equipment uses pressurized nitrogen gas to help  to provide extra power to devices such as .  Nitrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of , is used for the inflation of .ExecutionAs nitrogen is an asphyxiant gas, some jurisdictions have considered asphyxiation by inhalation of pure nitrogen as a means of  (as a substitute for ).However, as of 2020, no executions using nitrogen gas have yet been carried out by any jurisdiction, and at least one jurisdiction () which had considered nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution protocol had abandoned the effort.Main article:  Air balloon submerged in liquid nitrogenLiquid nitrogen is a  which looks like . When insulated in proper containers such as , it can be transported and stored with a low rate of . A container vehicle carrying liquid nitrogenLike , the main use of liquid nitrogen is for cooling to low temperatures. It is used in the  of biological materials such as blood and reproductive cells ( and ). It is used in  to remove cysts and warts on the skin by freezing them. It is used in laboratory , and in  to obtain lower pressures in  systems. It is used to cool heat-sensitive electronics such as  and . Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures where necessary. Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is often used for cooling even when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food,  livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.Although nitrogen is non-toxic, when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an  hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human  is a relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before the launch of the  on March 19, 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the  that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.When inhaled at high  (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30 m in ), nitrogen is an anesthetic agent, causing , a temporary state of mental impairment similar to  intoxication.Nitrogen dissolves in the  and body fats. Rapid decompression (as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called  (formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends), when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream, nerves, joints, and other sensitive or vital areas. Bubbles from other \"inert\" gases (gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen) cause the same effects, so replacement of nitrogen in  may prevent nitrogen narcosis, but does not prevent decompression sickness.As a  liquid, liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing  on contact, although the  provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, a young woman in England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.Because the liquid-to-gas  of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20 °C, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006, at , the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2 m off their foundations.Liquid nitrogen readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, and hence the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen. For example,  are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.Vessels containing liquid nitrogen can  from air. The liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point −183 °C, higher than that of nitrogen) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.Oxygen deficiency monitors are used to measure levels of oxygen in confined spaces and any place where nitrogen gas or liquid are stored or used. In the event of a nitrogen leak, and a decrease in oxygen to a pre-set alarm level, an oxygen deficiency monitor can be programmed to set off audible and visual alarms, thereby providing notification of the possible impending danger. Most commonly the oxygen range to alert personnel is when oxygen levels get below 19.5%. OSHA specifies that a hazardous atmosphere may include one where the oxygen concentration is below 19.5% or above 23.5%.Oxygen deficiency monitors can either be fixed, mounted to the wall and hard-wired into the building's power supply or simply plugged into a power outlet, or a portable hand-held or wearable monitor. . . 2009.^    Lide, David R.
